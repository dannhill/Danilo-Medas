<h1>Hello, I'm Danilo</h1>

<p>I am a 26-year-old Italian developer, currently completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. I am also a member of 42Rome, where I have successfully completed the common core. I have a great passion for video games, science, and mathematics, which together motivate me to learn and apply new programming, algorithm, and software design skills.</p>

<p>I currently primarily use Python and GDScript (Godot Engine) for my projects, though I also have experience with C/C++ (learned through 42Rome projects), as well as Java and JavaScript (both learned at university). I am also interested in machine learning; in fact, I am developing a project called karpfish, which I will describe in more detail below.</p>

<p>I am currently unemployed, but I enjoy working on projects to learn new things and to gain more experience.</p>

<h2>My Main GitHub Projects</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/KarpLearning/karpfish">karpfish</a></strong> [With <a href="https://github.com/LucaFalasca">LucaFalasca</a>]: An artificial intelligence agent for Pok√©mon Showdown, utilizing reinforcement learning. Currently, the interface between the simulator and the agent has been completed, and we are progressing towards the machine learning part of the project.</li>

  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/dannhill/MonsterCollector">MonsterCollector</a></strong>: A simple prototype for a monster-collector-style battle mechanic, made using Godot Engine 4.</li>

  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/dannhill/OpenLumberjack">OpenLumberjack</a></strong> [collaborative]: A free and open implementation of a classic lumberjack minigame, developed in JavaScript.</li>

  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/dannhill/RandomizedMedianAlgorithm">RandomizedMedianAlgorithm</a></strong>: An implementation of the randomized median algorithm in C++ (for a university course).</li>

  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/dannhill/42_cpp">42 CPP Modules</a></strong>: A comprehensive project from 42 school, consisting of 9 modules (00-08), each exploring specific aspects of C++ (C++98 standard). This project was part of the common core at 42Rome, providing initial experience with C++.</li>
</ul>
